# Mars_Money

"Mars Money" is a project created to develop a monetary system for a new Mars colony. This new monetary system is based
on blockchain technology. We will use blockchain technology to define a new cryptocurrency called `KaseiCoin`. ("Kasei" means
"Mars" in Japanese). KaseiCoin is a `ERC-20` compliant fungible token. This project will launch a `crowdsale` that will allow
people who are moving to Mars to convert their earthling money to KaseiCoin.
